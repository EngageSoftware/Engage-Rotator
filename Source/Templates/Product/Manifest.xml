  <Description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Displays the image choosen in the top half of the display, with a pager overlaying it at the bottom of the image, and the content in the lower half.</p>
    <p>This template is designed to rotate the content and image at the same time, with a pager control in the middle. For best results, pager images should be proportionate to each other, as well as to the width of the area and number of slides used.</p>
    <p>The pager image for the current slide will have a small border around it. This template would make an ideal solution for rotating product banners, while showing their details below with a handy pager to thumb through individual products; however, how you use it is up to you!</p>]]>
