    <h3>Change Log</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Please Note:</strong> This version includes breaking changes to previous versions of Engage: Rotator</li>
        <li>The display is now controlled through HTML-based templates</li>
        <li>After upgrading from a previous version, the display of the rotator content (slides) <em>will</em> be different</li>

        <li>Added many more options for the rotation</li>
        <li>Many new animation types</li>
        <li>The ability to display slides in a random order</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where slides were stored by TabModuleID, meaning that copying an existing Rotator module onto a different page would not copy the slides</li>
        <li>More details can be found on the <a href="http://support.engagemodules.com/Project/Project.aspx?Tab=Changelog&amp;PROJID=8">Engage: Rotator Change Log</a></li>
